# Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with the tool to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

# How We Teach This

What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented? As a continuation of existing Bundler patterns, or as a
wholly new one?

Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the Bundler documentation will need
to be re-organized or altered? Does it change how new users are taught to
manage dependencies? How should this change be introduced and taught to
existing users?

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on existing users, on
the documentation, on the integration of this feature with other existing and
planned features, on the impact on existing apps, etc.

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
