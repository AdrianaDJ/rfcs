# Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Guide-level explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already implemented and released, and you were teaching it to another developer. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how users should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use Bundler. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing users and new users.

For implementation-oriented RFCs, this section should focus on how contributors should think about the change, and give examples of its concrete impact. For policy RFCs, this section should provide an example-driven introduction to the policy, and explain its impact in concrete terms.

# Reference-level explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on existing users, on the documentation, on the integration of this feature with other existing and planned features, on the impact on existing apps, etc.

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

# Rationale and Alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before it is on by default?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?
